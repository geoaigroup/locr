# Lebanese Observatory for Crashes on Road (LOCR)  

LOCR platform serves to collect and analyze road crash events using crowd-sourcing approach from social media (notably Twitter and Facebook). Developed by a group led by Dr Ali J. Ghandour, LOCR has been in production since 2015 at the National Center for Remote Sensing â€“ CNRS.  
LOCR is the only real-time and openly available Lebanese spatio-temporal road crashes database. Events collection, classification and visualization is done autonomously, without any human intervention, by employing
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Fine-grained data and comprehensive reporting is not the objective of this work, but rather LOCR serves to mine and analyze spatio-temporal road crashes trends using representative time-series. The data collected from this work has proven itself to be credible as it is has been used in multiple research projects so far as shown in the below link:
